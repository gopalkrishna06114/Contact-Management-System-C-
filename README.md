📋 How to Run the Project
  Steps:
    1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-management-system.git
    2. Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE (CodeBlocks, Visual Studio, etc.) or terminal-based compiler.
    3. Compile the code.
    4. Run the executable.

🎮 How to Use
+ The program displays an interactive menu with options to:

    + Add, view, search, delete, and edit contacts.

+ Contacts are stored in a binary file (contacts.dat) to retain data between sessions.

+ The user can continue using the system until they choose to exit.


📌 Limitations
+ No advanced input validation (e.g., phone/email format checks).

+ Console-based, no graphical interface.

+ Currently designed for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.


🚀 Future Improvements
+ ✅ Add input validation for phone numbers and emails.

+ ✅ Improve cross-platform terminal experience.

+ ✅ Add sorting and filtering features.

+ ✅ Build a graphical user interface (GUI) using Qt or C++ libraries.

+ ✅ Export contacts to CSV or text files.
